        <h1>Heart rate training</h1>
        <b>HR - heart rate</b>
        When the app receives a heart rate from your heart rate mesauring device, it is presented here. “...” indicates no heart rate has been received yet. If the time since the last heart rate measurement has been received exceeds 10 seconds, the number indicating the heart rate will be colored red.
        
        <b>HRmax - maximum heart rate</b>
        The maximum heart rate is necessary to make the % display work correctly. Exercise programs based on heart rates normally give the zone to exercise in % intervals. The % presented is calculated as follows: (HR/HRmax)*100
        
        The HRmax field will automatically update itself if an HR above the current HRmax is measured. You can also set the HRmax manually by touching the input field and enter your own value.
        
        <b>HRrest - resting heart rate</b>
        The resting heart rate is the minimum heart rate measured by the app. This could have been called HRmin, but the tradition is to use HRrest. The HRrest field will automatically update itself if an HR below the current HRrest is measured. You can also set the HRrest manually by touching the input field and enter your own value.
        
        <b>HRrecovery - recovery heart rate</b>
        This is the difference between the heart rate when you stopped exercising and the heart rate after the recovery interval. You specify the recovery interval in seconds and start the recovery interval by pressing the start recovery button
        
        <b>Audio cues</b>
        This is the time between each audio cue in seconds. You can increase or decrease it by touching the + and - signs. You can also touch the input field and enter a value manually.
